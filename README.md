## Hi, I’m [@CharlesWithC](https://github.com/CharlesWithC)
**Software Architect + DevOps + Full-stack Developer**  
- I design logical stuff, automate delivery stuff and architect infrastructure stuff.
- I write code - mostly for my complicated logical stuff and CI/CD, sometimes for regular business logic.

**Education / Experience**
- BSc. Computer Science at University of Toronto
- Founder / Developer at [CHub](https://drivershub.charlws.com) (TruckSim stuff)
  - Technical experiment especially in backend.
  - Open sourced since December 2025! See [HubBackend](https://github.com/CharlesWithC/HubBackend) and [HubFrontend](https://github.com/CharlesWithC/HubFrontend).
- ~~Chief Technology Officer at Mermory~~ (no longer exists)
  - I managed to keep it a no-slop startup with full self-managed infrastructure while it lasted.
  - Disclaimer: There's nothing wrong in its tech and I tried to save it but it's out of my pay grade.
