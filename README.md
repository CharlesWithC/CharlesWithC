## Hi, I’m [@CharlesWithC](https://github.com/CharlesWithC)
**Software Architect + Engineer + DevOps**  
- I design logical stuff, automate delivery stuff and architect infrastructure stuff.
- I write code - mostly for my complicated logical stuff, and sometimes for regular business logic.

**Education / Experience**
- BSc. Computer Science at University of Toronto
  - I would say I am more of an ECE person with an interest in CSC theory stuff.
  - Blatantly speaking CSC education is cooked with how things are structured and how much you can self-study.
- Founder / Developer at [CHub](https://drivershub.charlws.com) (TruckSim stuff)
  - Technical experiment especially in backend.
  - Open sourced since December 2025! See [HubBackend](https://github.com/CharlesWithC/HubBackend) and [HubFrontend](https://github.com/CharlesWithC/HubFrontend).
- ~~Chief Technology Officer at Mermory~~ (no longer exists)
  - I managed to keep it a no-slop startup with full self-managed infrastructure while it lasted.
  - Disclaimer: There's nothing wrong in its tech and I tried to save it but it's out of my pay grade.
 
**Current Status**
- Learning Rust because I like it.
  - Possibly building a project with Rust as backend (which is total overkill but interesting)
- Pivoting to research because I have had enough slop in current-day software engineering.
  - Likely also pivoting to ECE because I like hardware and touching metal.
  - Disclaimer: I acknowledge that good software engineering still exists but it's hard to find.

<!-- Planning to do a MASc. ECE w/ electives in aero for fun -->
<!-- Planning to move to Europe b/c TTC sucks too much -->
